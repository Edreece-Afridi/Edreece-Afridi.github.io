Edreece Afridi Individual Assignment


For the development I used Bootstrap 4 for HTML/CSS. I was planning on using Javascript for Validation on the forms.

For Field Validation, I planned on using Javascript to validate the form from Bootstrap html.

For Maps, I didn't use anything and was planning on watching a video to assist with that.

For captcha, I was also planning on using a vide to assist with that.

For testing, I used a method="GET" to see if my form was sending input to my Results page. It only got the first name, and not the other input names.

The only attachments I have are: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70357837/144699271-1aee02b1-6dc5-4739-a510-44ed5b69da3d.png)

For this work, I was working alone, if we don't count online resources such as W3Schools or Youtube videos.

Documentation and Code I deveoped for this assignment are in in this Github.
